input: 
birth_year = 2005 
birth_month = 12 
birth_day = 16 

logic #1: 
- find age in years (subtract birth year from current year - ex: 2021-2001)
        - computing current year: current_year=$(date '+%Y') 
        - compute expected year: expected_year = current_year-birth_year 
- find months until birthday (find absolute value of "current month - birth month" - ex: 2-12=10)
        - computing current month: current_month=$(date '+%m')
        - compute expected month: expected_month = current_month-birth_month 
- find days between day born in birth month and day of this month (absolute value of "day in the month - birth day" - ex: 22-16)
        - computing current day: current_date=$(date '+%d')
        -  
- logic implementation check: 
    - sample imput for Kashvi: 
    expected_year = 2021-2005 = 16
        expected_year = expected_year-1 (only if the month is negative)
    expected_month = 2-12 = -10 
        if the month is negative, then subtract current month from birth month and subtract one from expected year 

expected output: 
your exact age is: 15 years, 2 months, and 8 days
