# variables
price=500 
discount=50/100 

## conditional statements 
if (age>60) then price=400 
    else if (age < 6) then price = 500
    else price = 600 
total = price-(price * discount)
    
# total_ticket = 500-(500 * 0.50) 
ternary operator 
price = age > 60 ? 400 : 500 

# loop (repeated programmed actions)
- for loop (do this for a given range)
- while loop (do this until a certain condition is true)
- do while loop (no matter what, condition true or false, do this at least once)

# arrays (collection of numbers/strings/objects/etc.)
- nyc to seattle (price : 200)
- nyc to nj (price : 50)
- prices = ["nyc to seattle", 200, "nyc to nj", 50]
- price_city ["nyc to seattle", "nyc to nj"]
- price_actual [200, 50]
- price_actual [1] (computer starts from 0, not 1, so this is for nyc to nj)
